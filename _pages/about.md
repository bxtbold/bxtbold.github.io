I am a robotics software engineer specializing in **robotics manipulation**, **task and motion planning**, and **robotics reasoning and action**, based in Seoul, South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·.

Since 2022, I have been working at [Plaif](http://www.plaif.com), where I focus on developing single- and dual-arm robotic systems.
My work involves developing algorithms and systems that enable robots to perform complex tasks, from task planning and motion control to real-time execution, ensuring efficient and reliable robotic operations.

My vision is to create fully autonomous robots that seamlessly operate in every environment, making intelligent automation accessible and impactful everywhere.

Originally from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡³, I bring a diverse background and a strong commitment to advancing robotics technology. Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my projects and contributions or connect with me directly.
